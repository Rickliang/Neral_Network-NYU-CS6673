Catalog Description
This course gives an introduction to neural network models and their applications. Or- ganization and learning in neural network models including perceptrons, adalines, back- propagation networks, recurrent networks, adaptive resonance theory and the neocog- nitron are discussed. Application in areas such as decision systems, nonlinear control, speech processing and vision is explored.
Prerequisites
The pre-requisite for this course is CS 540 or its equivalent. Undergraduate student may take this course if they have already taken CS 1114 or CS1133, and the undergraduate math sequence. Basically the student must be capable of writing computer programs in a modern programming language to solve scientific and engineering problems. There is no specific programming language that is required.
